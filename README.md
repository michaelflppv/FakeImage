# Image Classification Project

This project is a simple image classification model built with Python and TensorFlow. It uses a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify images as either "REAL" or "FAKE".

## Requirements

- Python
- TensorFlow
- Keras
- PIL
- numpy

## How to Run

1. Clone this repository.
2. Install the required packages.
3. Run `main.py`.

## Training

To train the model, run `main.py` and enter "train" when prompted. The model will be trained using the images in the `directory/train` directory. The trained model will be saved as `trained_model.keras`.

## Testing

To test the model, run `main.py` and enter "test" when prompted. You will be asked to provide the path to the image you want to test. The model will classify the image as either "REAL" or "FAKE".

## Note

Please ensure that the images are in the correct directory and that the paths are correctly specified in the `main.py` file.
